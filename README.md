<h1 align="center">An app for mapping and calculating coordinates from an uploaded photography to a canvas, in the right ratio</h1>
<h3 align="center">This is a simple app made by request, which proved to be a fun little project. The app has two activites, one which is used as a calculator for computing the position of the desired coordinates on a canvas, and one which allows the user to upload the phodo from the gallery. Then, by clicking on a point in the image, the calculated coordinates of a point on a canvas of desired dimensions are shown. Below is the current application.</h3>

* Currently, I am working on enabling zoom in and out, applying grid over the image for easier visualisation and creating separate fragments for horizontal and vertical images, in order to improve the performance of the app.
